Ruby Web App Example (Sinatra)
==============================

This is a basic web application that will show you how to create, load, edit,
and delete users. We've used Sinatra as the platform for building this sample
application - so getting up and running is a snap!

To run this sample application, you will need both the Stormpath Ruby SDK and
Sinatra gems, which can be installed via the following commands:

    gem install stormpath-sdk
    gem install sinatra

Then, in the cloned project:

    ruby ./app.rb

This will start the application, which you should be able to read in your web
browser by hitting http://localhost:4567
