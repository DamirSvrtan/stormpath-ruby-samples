# Stormpath Ruby Examples

Stormpath is the first easy, secure user management and authentication service
for developers. This project brings you several sample applications that you can
use as a guide to get you started with Stormpath:

1.  A CLI, which connects to Stormpath and verifies that resources can be
    obtained from your tenant.

1.  A reference web application built with Sinatra, demonstrating how the
    Ruby SDK allows you to easily interact with the Stormpath API.

1.  A Rails web application featuring lazy-loaded, Stormpath-augmented user
    models. Log in, create users, modify them with complete source code to
    get you up and running in minutes.
