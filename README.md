# Stormpath Ruby Examples

Stormpath is the first easy, secure user management and authentication service
for developers. This project brings you several sample applications that you can
use as a guide to get you started with Stormpath:

1.  A reference web application built with Sinatra, demonstrating how the
    [Stormpath Ruby SDK][stormpath-sdk] allows you to easily interact with the
    Stormpath API.

1.  A Rails web application featuring lazy-loaded, Stormpath-augmented user
    models. Log in, create users, modify them with complete source code to
    get you up and running in minutes. Uses the
    [Stormpath Rails gem][stormpath-rails] to link your models to resources in
    the Stormpath system.

1.  An example of using the [Stormpath OmniAuth Strategy][stormpath-omniauth]
    in a basic Sinatra application.
